---Convert one neo-tree (nui) node into the adapter contract's node shape.

---reason the caller can see.
---
---`line_number` is the contract's 1-based line, and is the caller's to supply
---— it is the one field that does not come from the node itself.
---
---Neo-tree's `type = "message"` nodes — the `(N hidden items)` /
---`(empty folder)` lines — are not nodes in the contract's sense and come back
---nil. They carry a synthetic id (`…/.git_hidden_message`) that `node_path`
---happily reports as a path, which then makes every caller treat a notice as a
---file: a stat of something that does not exist per render, and, on
---`get_current_node`, a `d`/rename aimed at it.
---
---`is_link`/`link_to` cost nothing extra here: neo-tree's own scan
---(`file-items.lua`) already calls `uv.fs_readlink()` for every symlink it
---finds and stores the result on the item as `is_link`/`link_to`, which
---`ui/renderer.lua` then copies onto the nui node unchanged. Reading those two
---fields is a plain table access, same cost class as `node.name` above — not a
---filesystem call, so it does not reintroduce the per-node `stat` this module
---was fixed to avoid (see `node_is_dir`'s comment and
---`docs/FEATURES/BACKENDS.md`'s "Line-resolved decorations").
---
---`link_broken`: a symlink's `node.type` stays the literal `"link"` only when
---neo-tree's own `uv.fs_stat()` of the target failed (see `node_is_dir`'s
---comment above) — i.e. exactly the dangling-link case. Any other type on a

-- ── Render-event bridge ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

-- Neo-tree redraws its buffer on its own schedule, not just when filetree asks
-- it to: a git-status fetch landing, a filesystem-watcher event, a background
-- diagnostics update, `follow_current_file`, all rewrite the tree buffer from
-- scratch. Any decoration drawn as an extmark on the previous render (marks'
-- checkmarks, most visibly -- see the bug this fixes: a checkmark surviving
-- only until the next such redraw, which reads as "vanishes after a second")
-- gets wiped along with it. Callers that need to redraw a decoration in sync
-- with neo-tree's OWN render cycle -- not just filetree's BufEnter/BufWritePost
-- dispatch -- subscribe here instead of guessing at a poll interval.
--
-- Two DIFFERENT neo-tree code paths end a render, and only one of them fires
-- an event: `ui/renderer.lua`'s `show_nodes` (a full filesystem-rescan pass --
-- `refresh()`, `navigate()`, the first render after `:Neotree show`) rebuilds
-- the whole node tree and fires `events.AFTER_RENDER` at the very end. But
-- `renderer.redraw(state)` -- called from a dozen NARROWER call sites that
-- only need to re-draw already-set nodes without rescanning anything, most
-- notably `sources/manager.lua`'s `opened_buffers_changed` (wired to
-- `enable_opened_markers`/`enable_modified_markers`, both default-on: ANY
-- buffer opening or closing ANYWHERE in the session redraws EVERY tracked
-- per-tab tree, including ones on background tabs the user never touched) --
-- only calls a local `render_tree(state)` (`state.tree:render()` plus cursor
-- restore) and never reaches `show_nodes` at all, so it never fires
-- AFTER_RENDER. `state.tree:render()` is still a real NuiTree buffer-content
-- replace though -- it does not carry extmarks over, same as any other
-- render -- so a subscriber that only listens for AFTER_RENDER silently misses
-- this whole class of redraw, and whatever it drew (a symlink sign, a mark
-- checkmark) on a background tab's tree stays gone until that tab's OWN tree
-- gets a real AFTER_RENDER of its own (its own focus, its own rescan).
--
-- Closed below by also monkeypatching `renderer.redraw` itself (see
-- `install_redraw_hook`) rather than parallel-listening for neo-tree's own
-- BufAdd/BufDelete/BufWipeout autocmds and guessing at its 200ms debounce from
-- the outside: every one of those call sites reaches `renderer.redraw` through
-- a plain field lookup on the shared `neo-tree.ui.renderer` module table
-- (`local renderer = require("neo-tree.ui.renderer")`, then
-- `renderer.redraw(state)`), resolved at CALL time -- not a function value
-- captured once at neo-tree's own `setup()` time the way each event queue's
-- subscriber list is (see `M.opened_buffers_changed`'s callers) -- so
-- wrapping it here is visible to EVERY caller regardless of load order, the
-- same reasoning `install_reveal_guard` below already relies on for
-- `commands.execute`. It also runs synchronously, inside neo-tree's own
-- callstack, immediately after the real redraw -- no timing window to race,
-- and no separate debounce interval of this module's own to keep in sync with
-- neo-tree's should that ever change. (It also, as a side effect, closes the
-- identical gap for every OTHER narrow-redraw call site -- diagnostics,
-- dir-changed, clipboard changes, several `sources/common/commands.lua`

---Hoist the `renderer.redraw` monkeypatch to install BEFORE anyone else's
---FIRST `require("neo-tree.ui.renderer")` -- closing a gap `install_redraw_hook`
---alone cannot: neo-tree's own `sources/filesystem/commands.lua` does
---`local redraw = renderer.redraw` at ITS OWN module-load time (a plain Lua
---upvalue, captured once, not a field lookup) -- and that module is required
---EAGERLY, for every configured source, from inside neo-tree's own `setup()`
---(see `setup/init.lua`: `source_default_config.commands = ... or
---require(mod_root .. ".commands")`). For a commonly lazy-loaded neo-tree.nvim
---(`cmd = "Neotree"` / `ft = "neo-tree"`), that `setup()` call itself only
---runs on the user's FIRST `:Neotree` invocation -- so `install_render_hook`'s
---own retry loop, which only starts once THIS module's `on_render` is first
---called (from marks/link_marker's own `setup()`), can lose the race
---entirely: by the time it gets a turn, `commands.lua` may already have
---captured the pre-patch `renderer.redraw` into its own local, permanently,
---for the rest of the session -- the four clipboard commands bound through it
---(`y`/`x`/`<Esc>`/`p` by default) then never notify this bridge again, no
---matter how many times `renderer.redraw` itself gets patched afterwards
---(Lua upvalues do not re-resolve to a table's current field value).
---
---Patching the table field later cannot retroactively fix an already-
---captured local anywhere else in the process -- so the fix has to be
---structural: win the race instead of running faster. `package.preload`
---is Lua's own hook for "run this the FIRST time -- and only the first time
----- anyone requires this module name", checked by `require()` before the
---normal file-based searchers and cached into `package.loaded` exactly the
---same way a normal `require` result is. Installing our own preload entry
---here means the very FIRST `require("neo-tree.ui.renderer")` from ANYONE --
---including from inside neo-tree's own `setup()` -- returns an
---ALREADY-patched module table, before any caller's own top-level
---`local redraw = renderer.redraw` can run. This wins regardless of whether
---neo-tree.setup() runs before or after THIS function, as long as THIS
---function runs before neo-tree.ui.renderer is first required by anyone --
---which is why it's called eagerly, at THIS adapter module's own load time
---(see the bottom of this file), rather than only from marks/link_marker's
---`setup()` the way `install_render_hook` is.
---
---Residual limitation, clearly disclosed rather than papered over (see
---docs/FEATURES/BACKENDS.md): if `neo-tree.ui.renderer` is ALREADY loaded by
---the time this runs (e.g. the user's own config calls
---`require("neo-tree").setup()` -- which itself requires `commands.lua`,
---which requires `renderer` -- before `require("filetree").setup()` /
---`require("filetree.adapter.neotree")` ever runs), hoisting is no longer
---possible: `commands.lua` has already captured whatever `renderer.redraw`
---was at that point. The fallback branch below still patches the field
---directly (matching this module's previous, pre-fix behavior) so every
---OTHER narrow-redraw call site (the ones that resolve `renderer.redraw` via
---a live field lookup, not a captured local -- see the "Render-event bridge"
---comment above) still benefits, but `commands.lua`'s own four clipboard
---commands specifically stay unpatched for that session. Loading
---filetree.nvim's setup before neo-tree.nvim's own setup() call (e.g. neither
---plugin lazy-loaded past VimEnter, or filetree declared as neo-tree's own
---plugin-manager dependency) avoids this entirely.

---call `require(name)` to get the real module: `require` is not reentrant for
---a module whose loader is still running -- calling it again for the SAME

---it on every one of filetree.nvim's own calls isn't enough — ANY code that
