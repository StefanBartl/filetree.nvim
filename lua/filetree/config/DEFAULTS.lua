---@module 'filetree.config.DEFAULTS'
--- Plugin-side default configuration.
---
--- The single source of truth for filetree.nvim's built-in defaults. User config
--- passed to `require("filetree").setup({})` is deep-merged on top of this table
--- (see `filetree.config`). Per-feature defaults that are not listed here live in
--- the feature module itself; this table only carries the cross-cutting options
--- and the few features whose defaults are worth surfacing centrally.
