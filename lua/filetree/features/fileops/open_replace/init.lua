---@module 'filetree.features.fileops.open_replace'
--- Open the node under the cursor into an existing editor window, in the two
--- shapes that differ in what becomes of the buffer already sitting there.
---
---   `O`                 Replace: `:edit` over the editor window. The previous
---                       buffer stays in the buffer list, it just is not on
---                       screen any more.
---   `<M-CR>`/`<C-CR>`   Swap: the previous buffer is closed as well, and the
---                       new file takes over the slot it held in the bufferline.
---
--- Swap is the one to reach for when the buffer list is a working set rather
--- than a history: opening five files to find the one you wanted otherwise
--- leaves four behind to close by hand.
---
--- ### Keeping the slot
---
--- That part needs a buffer list that has slots to keep. Neovim's own order is
--- the buffer numbers, and those only ever increase -- a file opened now can
--- never sort ahead of one opened earlier, and no API moves it, because there
--- is nothing to move: the order is not stored anywhere, it is derived. Tabline
--- plugins in the NvChad lineage solve this with `vim.t.bufs`, a per-tabpage
--- list they order themselves, and that list *can* be rewritten -- so the new
--- buffer is put back at the index the replaced one held.
---
--- Without such a list the swap still swaps; the new file simply lands wherever
--- its buffer number puts it, which is last. Nothing errors and nothing is
--- configured for it -- the list is either there or it is not.
---
--- The rewrite happens twice on purpose, once inline and once on the next tick.
--- `:edit` and `nvim_buf_delete` both drive the tabline plugin's own autocmds,
--- and whether those have finished appending the new buffer by the time this
--- returns is the plugin's business, not something to depend on. Placing the
--- buffer is idempotent, so the second pass either corrects a late append or
--- changes nothing.
---
--- Config:
---   enabled          boolean
---   keymap           string?   Replace key (default "O").
---   keymap_swap      string?   Swap key (default "<M-CR>").
---   keymap_swap_alt  string?   Second swap key (default "<C-CR>").
---   close_tree       boolean   Close the tree after `keymap` (default true).
---   swap_close_tree  boolean   Close the tree after a swap (default false).
---   keep_position    boolean   Give the new buffer the replaced one's slot
---                              (default true).
