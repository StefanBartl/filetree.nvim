---@module 'filetree.features.ui.cursor_hide'
---@brief Hide the block cursor while the tree window is focused.
---@description
--- Creates a window-local highlight override (winhighlight) so the cursor
--- disappears when focus is inside a tree buffer, and reappears on leave.
--- Uses a dedicated `FiletreeCursorHidden` hl group with blend=100 so the
--- global Cursor group is never touched.
---
--- Adapter-agnostic: the tree filetypes come from the active adapter's
--- optional `filetypes` capability (same pattern as window_style), so this
--- generalizes to whichever backend is configured. A superset covering all
--- known trees is used as a fallback when an adapter omits it.
---
--- The winhighlight entry is merged into whatever is already set on the
--- window rather than replacing it outright, so it survives regardless of
--- whether the tree plugin's own winhighlight (e.g. neo-tree's Normal/
--- NormalNC/... mapping) was applied before or after this handler runs.
---
--- ### The `'cursorline'` guard
---
--- Hiding the real block cursor only makes sense as long as SOMETHING else
--- marks where the cursor is -- normally the tree plugin's own `'cursorline'`
--- highlight. Nothing here controls that option; it is entirely up to the
--- adapter/colorscheme/user config to leave it on. If it ever ends up off
--- while the real cursor is hidden -- another plugin's own "cursorline only
--- in the active window" autocmd racing this one, a colorscheme reset, a
--- config change -- the tree window shows literally no position indicator at
--- all: not a redraw glitch, just nothing, indistinguishable from having lost
--- the cursor. Movement (`j`/`k`, opening nodes, closing the window) still
--- works throughout, since the cursor is very much still there -- just
--- invisible. Reported 2026-09-23: after some unidentified sequence in real
--- use, the block cursor came back on leaving the tree, as always, but never
--- reappeared IN the tree afterwards -- restarting Neovim was the only fix
--- found. `force_cursorline` (default true) is the guard: whenever this
--- hides the block cursor, it also force-enables `'cursorline'` on that
--- window, remembering whatever it was so `apply_show` can restore the exact
--- previous value on leave (not just re-enable/re-disable blindly, in case
--- the user had it deliberately off in a given window). Set false to go back
--- to leaving `'cursorline'` alone.
---
--- Config:
---   enabled           boolean (default true)
---   force_cursorline  boolean (default true) -- see above
---
--- Note: could not be confirmed via headless Neovim testing (no UIEnter
--- without a real UI attached makes VeryLazy fire unpredictably relative to
--- a scripted test). Confirmed working in real interactive use.
