---@module 'filetree.features.ui.context_menu'
---@brief Right-click context menu in the tree, via ui.contextmenu.
---@description
--- Binds a mouse trigger (default `<RightMouse>`) inside the tree buffer.
--- On click: moves the cursor to the clicked node first (so the menu acts on
--- what was actually clicked, not wherever the cursor happened to be), then
--- opens the menu through `ui.contextmenu`, populated with
--- `filetree.integrations.menu.items()` — the SAME curated, self-gating entry
--- list a host config could already wire up by hand. This feature only adds
--- the trigger; which entries appear is still controlled entirely by the
--- top-level `menu` config (group-level opt-out — see @types/config.lua).
---
--- Only a click on a text row of the tree opens it. A click anywhere else --
--- the empty area below the last node, the tree's statusline / winbar /
--- vertical separator, another window -- opens no menu and leaves the cursor
--- alone. `keymap` is a MOUSE trigger: it reads the pointer position.
---
--- `ui.contextmenu` resolves its own renderer -- nvzone/menu when it is
--- installed, `ui.kit.menu` (no third-party dependency) otherwise --
--- so this feature needs neither directly. It is never require()d until the
--- first click. On by default (opt-out); degrades to a single notify, not an
--- error, only if ui.nvim itself predates `ui.contextmenu`.
---
--- Two extras, both kit-renderer only (ui.contextmenu has no
--- equivalent hook for nvzone/menu, so they no-op there):
---  * the clicked node's line is highlighted for as long as the menu stays
---    open, so it is never ambiguous which node an entry would act on;
---  * with the tree docked left/right, the menu opens beside the tree
---    window instead of at the click -- which would otherwise sit on top
---    of, and often fully hide, the very row it is highlighting.

---@internal
--- Highlight the node the menu is about to act on. A one-shot fallback
--- (the next time the cursor actually moves within the tree buffer) also
--- clears it, in case the renderer never gives back a close hook to do it
--- promptly (nvzone/menu has none) or the menu fails to open at all.
---
--- Deliberately `CursorMoved` only, NOT `BufLeave`: opening the menu itself
--- moves focus to its own window (kit's float is `enter = true`; nvzone/menu
--- likely does the same), which fires `BufLeave` on the tree buffer as a
--- pure side effect of the menu appearing -- before the user has even seen
--- it. That cleared the highlight instantly on every click, which is a
--- silent no-op from the user's perspective: indistinguishable from the
--- highlight never having been applied at all. `CursorMoved` only fires
--- from an actual cursor move while the tree buffer is the one being
--- edited, which cannot happen while a floating menu holds focus.
---
--- Applied three times, not once: `move_to_click`'s cursor move can itself
--- set off a reactive re-render in the tree plugin behind the adapter --
--- often debounced -- and a same-tick extmark can be wiped moments later by
--- that re-render with nothing visibly wrong at click time (confirmed live:
--- `adapter.highlight_node()` reports success, the row never actually shows
--- highlighted). Immediate + next-tick (`vim.schedule`) + a delayed pass
--- past typical debounce windows (`vim.defer_fn`, 150ms) covers same-tick,
--- next-tick and debounced wipes without this needing to know which one a
--- given backend actually does. Nothing here reaches into a specific tree
--- plugin -- every attempt goes through `_adapter.highlight_node`, same as
--- the very first one did.
