---@module 'filetree.features.nav.cwd_mode'
--- Root policy: decide *where* the cwd and the tree root belong.
---
--- cwd_sync answers "the buffer changed, now what?" statelessly — it
--- re-resolves a root from the file on every BufEnter. A *mode* is by
--- definition state: "keep the cwd here regardless of which buffer is
--- focused". This module holds that state; cwd_sync stays the executor and
--- asks `decide()` before it changes anything.
---
--- Modes:
---
---   follow    No policy — cwd_sync's own resolution applies unchanged
---             (root_markers → project_root → the file's parent). `decide()`
---             deliberately returns nil here, so enabling this feature with
---             the default mode changes no behaviour at all.
---   project   The cwd stays at the current project root as long as the
---             focused file lives inside it, and only moves when a file
---             outside it is opened. With `project.sticky` (default) a file
---             with no detectable root of its own — a scratch note, a file
---             in /tmp — does not drag the cwd along either.
---   lock      The cwd is pinned to one directory. Buffer switches never
---             move it, and with `lock.enforce` (default) neither does
---             foreign code: a `lib.nvim.fs.dir_guard` reverts a `:cd` from
---             a picker, a session restore or another plugin.
---   manual    Nothing automatic. The cwd and the tree root only change
---             through explicit action (`+`/`-`, `:Filetree cwd …`).
---
--- The mode is shown as a badge in the bottom-left of the tree window
--- ("PROJECT", "LOCK", "MANUAL"; nothing in follow mode) — see `indicator`.
---
--- Because the pinned root is real state, other features can read it instead
--- of guessing from the cwd: `M.root()` is the authoritative answer to "which
--- project are we in right now".
