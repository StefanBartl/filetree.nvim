---@module 'filetree.util.tree_attach'
--- Central "on tree buffer" dispatcher for per-buffer setup (keymaps).
---
--- Instead of every feature registering its own `FileType` autocmd to bind
--- tree-buffer keymaps, features register a callback here and a single FileType
--- autocmd runs them all (scheduled, past the adapter's own keymap setup, with a
--- buffer-validity guard done once, centrally).
---
--- Lifecycle (driven by filetree.setup):
---   1. reset()            — clear callbacks (start of setup)
---   2. on_attach(fn)      — each enabled feature registers in its setup()
---   3. install(adapter)   — create the single FileType autocmd (end of setup)
---
--- `fn` receives the tree buffer number: `fn(buf)`.

---Clear all registered callbacks. Called at the start of setup so a re-setup
---does not accumulate stale bindings.

---Register a callback to run once for each tree buffer when it attaches.
---
---`feature` opts the callback into the source check: neo-tree draws its
---filesystem, buffer list, git status, symbol outline and diagnostics list
---through one `neo-tree` filetype, so "on a tree buffer" is five different
---trees. A feature named in `filetree.sources` runs only on the ones it lists;
---anything else runs everywhere, as all of them did before.

---Idempotent: clears and recreates its augroup. Call after all features'

      -- `b:neo_tree_source` in its renderer, which is after FileType -- nil in
      -- this callback, "filesystem" by the next tick (measured 2026-09-02).
      -- So the tick this has needed all along is exactly the one that makes a
      -- per-source decision possible here.
