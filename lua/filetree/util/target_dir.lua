---@module 'filetree.util.target_dir'
--- Shared "what project root does this file belong to" resolver.
---
--- Used by `cwd_sync` (to choose what to chdir/reveal to) and by
--- `auto_reveal` (to know where to re-root the tree for a file outside its
--- current root, when nothing else is already handling that -- see its
--- `follow_root` option). Kept in one place so both features agree on the
--- same directory for the same file: cwd_sync's chdir and auto_reveal's
--- re-root target the identical path, so either or both running for the
--- same buffer switch is redundant at worst, never conflicting.
---
--- Resolution order, first hit wins:
---   1. cwd_mode's marker walk (shared with `util.root`, find_files, grep,
---      git_status, so nothing that is "the project" can disagree). Skipped
---      when cwd_mode is disabled or torn down.
---   2. Nearest ancestor containing a configured stable marker (default
---      `.git`), via a cached lib.nvim finder. Disabled with
---      `root_markers = false`.
---   3. The project_root feature's broader marker set, when `use_project_root`.
---   4. The file's own parent directory.
